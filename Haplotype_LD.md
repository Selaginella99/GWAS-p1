[HaploReg v3](http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg_v3.php) is a tool for exploring annotations of the noncoding genome at variants on haplotype blocks, such as candidate regulatory SNPs at disease-associated loci. Using LD information from the 1000 Genomes Project, 
linked SNPs and small indels can be visualized along with their predicted chromatin state.
